## üì± Flutter üíô to Google Sheets üìä

A Demo application which stores User feedback from **Flutter Application** into **Google Sheets** using **Google AppScript**.

## üí° Introduction

- [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/) is a very powerful tool üî• if we look into deep in it.

- It provides us interface using [*Google AppScript*](https://script.google.com) so that we can do various types of operations on Google Spreadsheet.

- We can perform all types of operations like Reading/Inserting/Updating/Deleting using AppScript on Google Sheets. It's so much powerful and capable that we can even use Google Sheets as a backend of our application üì≤.

- Here we'll develop a sample flutter application, which simply takes user User Feedback, makes HTTP request to Google AppScript and AppScript then stores that feedback in Google Sheets.

- In other screen, we'll show feedback responses fetched from Google sheets into the List.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Setting up Google Sheets:

- Sign in with your Google Account.
  
- Go to your [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/) and create a new ‚ÄòGoogle Sheets‚Äô document where you want to store your responses and Open that.
  
- Setup **Header Columns** of sheet and you‚Äôll see like this.

As above, I‚Äôve set up header columns of the sheet. You can see I‚Äôve highlighted part of the URL. It is the Sheet ID of our current document. Just copy it, we‚Äôll require it in the next step. Every document has a unique Sheet ID.

- As in below Image, Just go to Tools ‚Üí Script Editor.

##‚ö°Ô∏è Setting up Google AppScript:

- After the above steps, you‚Äôll see AppScript Editor will be launched in the New Tab of your browser. You‚Äôll see Code window like below.

![](2021-08-10%2019_11_53-Untitled%20project%20-%20Project%20Editor.png)

Here in this editor, we have to write AppScript which will act as a Web API and that will communicate with Google sheets.

We‚Äôll write code in doPost() which will be invoked when HTTP request using method POST is sent.

```
function doPost(request){
  // Open Google Sheet using ID
  var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.openById("1OOArrqjOqmD4GiJOWlluZ4woTMH_qaV6RKv4JXnT3Hk");
  var result = {"status": "SUCCESS"};
  try{
    // Get all Parameters
    var name = request.parameter.name;
    var email = request.parameter.email;
    var mobileNo = request.parameter.mobileNo;
    var feedback = request.parameter.feedback;

    // Append data on Google Sheet
    var rowData = sheet.appendRow([name, email, mobileNo, feedback]);

  }catch(exc){
    // If error occurs, throw exception
    result = {"status": "FAILED", "message": exc};
  }

  // Return result
  return ContentService
  .createTextOutput(JSON.stringify(result))
  .setMimeType(ContentService.MimeType.JSON);
}
```

First of all, we‚Äôll have to Open our spreadsheet, we can open that using `SpreadsheetApp.openById(sheetId)`

**Sheet ID** which we‚Äôve copied in the previous step has to be passed in this method.

Here, we‚Äôll retrieve parameters using `request.parameter` . Finally, by using a method `appendRow([])` , we‚Äôll insert feedback data into Google Sheet. In the end, we‚Äôll return a JSON response with status: `**SUCCESS/FAILED**`.

- Select from Button, **Deploy ‚Üí New Deployment**

![](2021-08-10%2019_25_03-Settings.png)

It will show a pop-up like below, Click on Select type ‚Üí Web App

![](2021-08-10%2019_28_18-Untitled%20project.png)

- You‚Äôll see a window like this, Just ensure that select ‚ÄòExecute the app‚Äô as ‚ÄòMe‚Äô.

![](2021-08-10%2019_30_28-Untitled%20project.png)

- Select ‚ÄòWho has access to the app‚Äô as ‚ÄòAnyone‚Äô

![](2021-08-10%2019_33_07-Untitled%20project.png)

- Authorization is required! Just review permissions. Then select your Google Account.

- **Allow** these permissions and then you‚Äôre done!

![](2021-08-10%2019_42_23.png)

- Finally, you‚Äôll get a window like this with the **Web app URL**. Copy that **`Web URL`** for a reference. We‚Äôll use this `URL` for making `HTTP` `GET` requests from our flutter app.

![](2021-08-10%2019_33_57-Untitled%20project.png)

üòÉWe‚Äôve done this part. Let‚Äôs see Flutter implementation.

##

-  Now we‚Äôll be implementing `doGet()` method which will return the list of feedback responses as JSON array of objects üòÉ.

Now, Just open your **Google AppScript** code again and just add a new method `doGet()` as below.

```
function doGet(request){
  // Open Google Sheet using ID
  var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.openById("1OOArrqjOqmD4GiJOWlluZ4woTMH_qaV6RKv4JXnT3Hk");

  // Get all values in active sheet
  var values = sheet.getActiveSheet().getDataRange().getValues();
  var data = [];

  // Iterate values in descending order 
  for (var i = values.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {

    // Get each row
    var row = values[i];

    // Create object
    var feedback = {};

    feedback['name'] = row[0];
    feedback['email'] = row[1];
    feedback['mobile_no'] = row[2];
    feedback['feedback'] = row[3];

    // Push each row object in data
    data.push(feedback);
  }

  // Return result
  return ContentService
  .createTextOutput(JSON.stringify(data))
  .setMimeType(ContentService.MimeType.JSON);
}
```

Here‚Äôs a quick ‚ö°Ô∏è explanation for the above script:

- First of all, after opening Google Sheet, we‚Äôve received all values.

- Then iterating data in descending order so that we‚Äôll be able to see recent feedback item first.
  
- Adding each feedback to data.
  
- Finally returning data as a JSON.

## Deploy New version üöÄ :

- Once AppScript is ready, again deploy your AppScript by Selecting a tab: **Publish ‚Üí Deploy as a web app**.

- Assign a new version to your app and click **‚ÄòDeploy‚Äô** üöÄ.

- After that, you can check if it‚Äôs working or not by visiting that URL.

## What's Happening? ü§î

In flutter, when submit button is pressed, `HTTP` `POST` request is called on AppScript `URL` which retireves parameter from request and then appends row data in Google Sheets. Thus, data from flutter in inserted into Google Sheets. When `GET` request is sent to the same URL, it returns the List of feedback responses.
